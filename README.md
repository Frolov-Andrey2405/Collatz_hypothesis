# Collatz_hypothesis

Dive into the intriguing world of the Collatz sequence, also known as the 3n + 1 problem. This sequence of numbers, generated by applying specific rules to a starting number, has captured the curiosity of mathematicians and enthusiasts alike. Explore the mysterious behavior of the sequence and ponder its unproven conjecture â€“ that every starting number eventually reaches the value 1.

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a compatible environment.
2. Input a starting number to initiate the Collatz sequence.
3. Witness the sequence unfold as each iteration applies the rules.
4. Observe if the sequence indeed reaches the value 1.

## Features

- Experience the intriguing behavior of the Collatz sequence.
- Gain insight into a mathematical problem that remains unproven.
- Simple interface for exploring the sequence with any starting number.

## Instructions

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the program's directory.
3. Run the program using `python collatz.py`.
4. Enter a positive integer as the starting number for the sequence.
